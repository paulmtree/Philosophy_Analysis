# Overview
This README contains a brief overview and background of the project. If you would like to jump straight to the analysis, there are 2 files to read through with more on the way. The first is 
- Preliminary Sentiment Analysis: Importing, cleaning, and displaying sentiment data using VADER sentiment analysis.
- Text Generation (LSTM) (In Progress): Random text generation using Keras and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) framework. Currently using Google Colab to train model.

Future work will include text generation using transformers.


# Motivations
Kierkegaard's Either/Or explores one of human's most pondered questions, how should we live? It is an interesting book to analyze because it is composed of a narrator and the correspondences between two opposite-thinking psuedonyms of Kierkegaard, named A and B. The Preface is a story of how these papers were found, in an old desk (which is somewhat of a trope of Kierkegaard's, adding to the sense of mystery and discovery). The first part of the book of seven chapters is written by author A, titled Either and the last four chapters are written by B in response to A titled Or. Keep in mind the numbers represent when that chapter starts, chapter 7 The Seducer's Diary is written by A.

Authors A and B argue for two very different types of lifestyles. A argues for a lifestyle described by Kierkegaard as the aesthetic, generally living life with flexible morality and pursuing new and exciting experiences with no commitments. B on the other hand advocates for the ethical life, living life with set morals and pursuing lasting happiness through long-held relationships, like marriage. Our analysis investigates this philosophical divide by examining sentiment and we can isolate each author's works by their respective chapters.
